# Privacy Policy for Dieter Clock



**Last Updated:** December 2025

## Introduction

Dieter Clock ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our iOS and macOS application.

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

Dieter Clock is designed with privacy in mind. We **DO NOT**:

- Collect any personal information

- Track your usage or behavior

- Use analytics or tracking tools

- Share any data with third parties

- Require user accounts or registration

- Access your location

- Access your contacts

- Access your photos or files

- Send any data to external servers

- Use advertising networks or SDKs

**Note:** The app may request optional calendar access if you choose to enable the "Add to Apple Calendar" feature for habit tracking. This permission is entirely optional and user-controlled. See the "Optional Calendar Access" section below for details.

### Information Stored Locally

All data is stored **locally on your device only** and includes:

- **Timer Settings**: Your preferences for Pomodoro, Countdown, and Stopwatch timers

- **App Preferences**: Theme selection, display options, and general settings

- **Timer State**: Current timer status to maintain continuity when you close and reopen the app

- **Habit Data**: If you use the habit tracking feature, your habits, completion dates, and streaks are stored locally

This information is stored using iOS/macOS UserDefaults and **never leaves your device**.

### Optional Calendar Access

If you choose to enable the "Add to Apple Calendar" feature for habit tracking:

- **Calendar Permission**: The app will request access to your calendar to create reminder events

- **What We Access**: The app only creates new calendar events in a dedicated "Dieter Calendar" that it creates in your calendar app

- **What We Don't Access**: We do not read, modify, or delete any existing calendar events or data

- **Data Storage**: Calendar events are stored in your device's local calendar and synced through your iCloud account (if enabled). We do not have access to this data

- **User Control**: You can revoke calendar access at any time through iOS Settings, and you can delete the "Dieter Calendar" or individual events at any time

- **Privacy**: Calendar access is completely optional. The app works fully without calendar access, and you can use all other features without granting this permission

## How We Use Information

The locally stored settings are used exclusively to:

- Remember your timer preferences

- Maintain your selected theme and appearance settings

- Preserve timer state between app sessions

- Track your habits and completion streaks (if you use the habit tracking feature)

- Provide you with a personalized experience

If you enable calendar integration for habits:

- Create calendar reminder events for your scheduled habits

- Help you remember to complete your habits through calendar notifications

## Data Security

- All data is stored locally on your device using Apple's secure UserDefaults system

- No data is transmitted over the internet

- No data is stored on external servers

- Your data remains under your complete control

## Third-Party Services

Dieter Clock does **not** use any third-party services, including:

- Analytics services

- Crash reporting tools

- Advertising networks

- Social media integrations

- Cloud storage services

## Children's Privacy

Dieter Clock does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app is safe for users of all ages.

## Data Retention and Deletion

- All data is stored locally on your device

- You can delete all app data by deleting the application

- Reinstalling the app will start with fresh, default settings

- We have no access to your data and cannot retrieve it if deleted

- If you enabled calendar integration, you can delete the "Dieter Calendar" or individual events at any time through your calendar app

- Revoking calendar access in iOS Settings will prevent the app from creating new calendar events, but existing events will remain in your calendar until you manually delete them

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect any personal information:

- You have complete control over all app data on your device

- You can delete the app and all associated data at any time

- There is no account to manage or delete

- There is no data to request or export from us

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app update notes and by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Compliance

This app complies with:

- Apple App Store Guidelines

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

Since we collect no personal data, we are inherently compliant with all major privacy regulations.

## Apple Privacy Manifest

This app includes an Apple Privacy Manifest (PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy) that declares:

- We do not track users

- We do not collect data

- We only use UserDefaults for local preferences storage

- We only use System Boot Time API for timer functionality

- We may request calendar access (EventKit) if you enable the optional calendar integration feature for habit tracking

---

**Summary**: Dieter Clock respects your privacy completely. We don't collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information. Everything stays on your device, giving you complete privacy and control. The app may optionally request calendar access for habit reminders, but this is entirely user-controlled and the app works fully without it.

*"Less but Better" - including less data collection, for a better, more private experience.*
